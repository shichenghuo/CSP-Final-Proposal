### Summary

This project wants to encourage people to communicate and interact with each other through games that required collaboration and walking around the crowd. Today, with the rapid development of technology, we can see that in the cafe, in the bus stations, and in many places, most people choose to use mobile phones to browse information and meet people through the internet. However, in the same space, people have many opportunities to know each other. 

The project tries to provide a fun channel for people to meet with others. Users will be assigned a random blocks composition once they stand in the heated area. The block compositions can be combined with another person’s into a new shape. With the block they had, they need to find others who has a match block compositions with them.

---
Game mechanism options: 

1. When the user finds another user who has matched block compositions, the game will be upgraded to find two other users with phase formula blocks (the user will have a new block module).

2. When the user finds another user who has matched block compositions, the game mechanics remain the same and the big screen leaderboard is updated.

### What’s going to be hard/ uncertain?
- Detect the changing of position to change the position of Tetris
- How to store/generate a set of different blocks molecule in the project? 
- How to set the project and link it to the computer?
- How to set the webcam in the space?
- How operations can know individual users?
- How do users know Tetris is matching each other?
- How to prevent different Tetris from overlapping each other?
